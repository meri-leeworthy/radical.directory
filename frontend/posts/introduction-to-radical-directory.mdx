title: Introduction to Radical Directory

Pessimism about the possibility of radical social change is very convenient for
the oppressor. But who can blame us for feeling powerless? The structural
oppression we face at work, at home, in the street, is also mirrored in the
media we see on this platform. Micro-celebrities. Clicktivism. Entertainment.
Doomsday news. Hopelessness is a structure of feeling, when the algorithm
parades the fantasy of our power as individuals, and suppresses the reality of
our collective power when we organise in solidarity. Radical Directory is a
proposal for a new community-controlled platform that is oriented completely
toward collective action.
