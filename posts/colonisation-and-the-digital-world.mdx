title: Colonisation and the Digital World
author: Tori and Willow
---

Our collective live and work from the lands of the Wurundjeri-woi wurrung and
Boon wurrung peoples of the Kulin nations. We acknowledge the Elders of the
Kulin nations, and pay our deepest respect to the land, waters and air that
Wurundjeri-woi wurrung and Boon wurrung people have cared for and maintained
since time immemorial.

Our collective acknowledge that the city of Melbourne was built on the
dispossession, theft and violence carried out by the colonising forces, and
legislated by the federal government of Australia. Wurundjeri-woi wurrung and
Boon wurrung sovereignty has never been extinguished and remains true today.

Radical Directory is entering into an online world, a place with long histories
and traditions of anti-colonial resistance. We think it's important to learn
about these histories. First Nations people have harnessed some of the most
radical potential of the digital world from the early days of the internet. We
look to the radical Indigenous organisers behind People's Global Action, who
catalysed the anti-globalisation movement of the late 1990s using online forums.
We also look to sites
like [KooriWeb](http://www.kooriweb.org/) and [IndigenousX](https://indigenousx.com.au/),
which bring First Nations histories, stories and activism to ever wider
audiences. Today First Nations organisers standing up for Country from
Wet'suwe'ten to Djap Wurrung are heard across the planet using digital
platforms.

Radical Directory exists on the internet, but the internet is a physical thing,
made up of electricity, metals, plastics and the people who service it. The
procurement of these materials is tied up in a colonising system of resource
extraction here and in other parts of the world. We see the relationship between
the digital world and colonisation as tightly bound. Government surveillance and
appropriation of data was faced first and foremost by Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander people who came up against violent surveillance by British
colonisers. Today First Nations people are heavily scrutinised by a government
that continues to dispossess people of their land, using statistics to justify
policies of intervention. Being in control of how data is acquired and acted
upon is part
of [the struggle for data sovereignty](https://aiatsis.gov.au/publication/116530),
which we see as aligned with the goals of Radical Directory.

Finally, our collective would like to pay respect to the generations of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander activists, protectors and families who
have stood up for their Country and their community since invasion began. First
Nations organisers are at the forefront of every struggle today, whether that be
for climate justice, land justice, prison abolition, health access, housing, and
more. We agree that sovereignty is at the heart of every battle on stolen land.
As a collective we value all that we have learned from First Nations organisers
about how to be allies, or accomplices, and how to work in solidarity in the
struggle to decolonise the society we live in. We believe that decolonisation is
an
action, [not a metaphor](https://unsettlingamerica.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/deconstructing-knowledge-decolonization-is-not-a-metaphor/),
and that everyone has a role to play in this movement towards justice.
